              <h1 class="mb-5">Interest Rates</h1>
              <p><span class="firstcharacter">I</span>nterest rates are the cost of borrowing money. Lenders (often banks or other financial institutions) will lend money to borrowers (companies or individuals) so they can make purchases. But when the lending institutions lends money, they expect to eventually get back the amount they loaned (the principal balance) plus a little extra as an incentive to lend in the first place (interest). There are so many interest rates out there. The Federal Funds Rates, mortgage rates, LIBOR, SOFR, APR, APY. What are all of these interest rates? This post aims to  explain some of the important interest rates.</p>
              <p>First, let’s look at the details of how a loan works. Loans are generally repaid according to an amortization schedule so that for fixed-interest loans, the borrower pays fixed monthly installments until the debt is paid. Payments are most commonly made on a monthly basis, so if you take out a $120 loan with a 12% annual interest rate for 1 month, at the end of the month, you will pay back $121.20, which is consists of the $120 principal + $1.20 which represents 1% monthly interest or 1/12th of the 12% annual interest rate (12%/12 months = 1% of $120).</p>
              <p>If you pay the $120 loan back over 2 months and you want to pay the same fixed amount in both months, you will pay $60.90 each month. Since at the end of the 1st month, you still have the full $120 in debt, $1.20 of that $60.90 is counted towards interest and $59.70 is taken off the $120 principal leaving you with a remaining principal balance of $60.30 after your first payment. Interest only accrues on the remaining principal, so at the end of the 2nd month, your $60.90 payment consists of the remaining $60.30 + 1% of that balance ($0.603 rounded down to 60 cents).</p>
              <p>To take a longer term example, if you want to buy a house and you take out a $120,000 mortgage with a 12% annual interest rate for 30 years, you will pay $1,234.34 per month every month for 30 years for a total of 360 payments. $1,200 of your first payment will be the interest payment and $34.34 will be taken off your remaining principal balance. Over the course of 30 years, you will have paid a total of $444,360.64 (you pay a tiny bit less in the final month because of rounding we saw in the earlier example. Those tenths of cents add up in the long run). So to borrow $120,000, you will have paid $324,360.64 in interest. Borrowing can be expensive.</p>
              <p>Below, we will look at some of the key interest rates that are used or referenced frequently:</p>
              <p><b>Federal Funds Rate</b>: This is the target rate that the Federal Reserve’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) sets and announces in their meetings which happen 8 times a year. This interest rate is the rate at which banks borrow from one another overnight. Banks must hold a certain amount of reserve capital (usually 10% of their assets) in accounts with the Fed. But banks make many lend and trade many financial instruments over the course of the day and their assets fluctuate. So if at the end of the day, a bank has less than its required minimum reserve capital in the Federal Reserve account, they must borrow from a bank with excess reserves, and the interest rate on this loan is done at the FFR. The Fed cannot force banks to lend at the FFR it sets, but it influences bank to lend at the target rates through open-market operations—namely, buying or selling US Treasury securities. If it wants to raise the federal funds rate, it will sell Treasury bonds to banks with excess reserves, take that amount out of their reserve accounts, meaning those banks will charge higher interest rates to lend its now lower excess reserves to banks that need to supplement their reserves. This rate heavily influences all other interest rates in the US economy (mortgage rates, credit card rates, auto loan rates, etc.)</p>

                <figcaption>The Federal Funds Rate is set between 5.25% and 5.5% as of 3 November 2023</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p><b>Federal Discount Rate</b>: This is the interest rate at which eligible financial institutions borrow from the Federal Reserve itself (rather than from other commercial banks). This rate is set every 14 days and it is higher than the FFR because the Fed prefers when commercial banks borrow from each other to correct their capital reserves. The Fed will only lend to financial institutions in distress as a last resort.</p>
              <p>Freddie Mac’s <b>Primary Mortgage Market Survey (PMMS)</b>: This interest rate is published by Freddie Mac (the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation FHLMC) and is often cited as the most representative and reliable representation of the prevailing mortgage rates. They publish the weekly average interest rates for 30-year and 15-year fixed-rate mortgages. While each person’s individual mortgage rate will vary based on the local market conditions, borrower characteristics, the lending institution’s lending capacity, and other factors, the PMMS represents the expected average mortgage rates in the US.</p>
              <p>The Wall Street Journal <b>Prime Rate</b>: This interest rate is published by the Wall Street Journal and is used as an index for the rates on consumer loans such as credit cards and car loans. It moves in tandem with the FFR.</p>
              <p><b>London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)</b>: This <i>was</i> an important benchmark rate at which major global banks lent to each other in the international interbank market. It was set by asking banks how much they would be charged by other banks if they wanted to borrow money for short-term loans. They surveys included rates for 1-day, 1-week, 1-month, 2-month, 3-month, 6-month, and 12-month loans, but they have all been phased out. There was a major scandal involving this rate when it was revealed that banks were falsely inflating or deflating their rates to profit from trades, or to appear more creditworthy than they actually were.</p>
              <p><b>Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR)</b>: This international interbank rate has replaced the LIBOR and the financial institutions that use it have no direct control over it which makes this rate less susceptible to artificial inflation or deflation.</p>
              <p>ECB’s <b>Main Refinancing Operations</b>: This rate provides the bulk of liquidity to the European banking system and is the rate financial institutions pay when they borrow from the ECB for 1 week. When borrowing at this rate, institutions provide collateral (usually in the form of sovereign bonds) to the ECB to guarantee reimbursement.</p>
              <p>ECB’s <b>Marginal Lending Facility</b>: The overnight interest rate at which financial institutions borrow from the ECB. It is higher than the MRO.</p>
              <p>ECB’s <b>Deposit Facility</b>: The interest rate accrued on the money financial institutions deposit with the ECB.</p>
              <p><b>Annual Percentage Rate (APR)</b> vs. <b>Annual Percentage Yield (APY)</b>: APR represents the interest you will pay on borrowed money and does not account for compounding. APY does factor in compounding. Pay attention to this distinction when taking out loans because APY is higher than APR. When banks advertise savings account, they often cite the APY. Many savings accounts in the US are compounded daily and credited monthly. This means if you start with $1,000 in your savings account, you will accrue some interest on that $1,000 at the end of the 1st day. On the 2nd day, you accrue interest on the initial $1,000 + the interest from the 1st day. Some savings accounts are currently advertising savings accounts with 4.4% APY. Assuming your balance is compounded daily, this translates to an APR of 4.3062%. Compound interest is great when it’s working for you in a savings account, but can do serious damage if it’s working against you on debt. When banks advertise loan products (auto loans, credit cards), they will often cite the APR. If you don’t pay back your credit card in full at the end of the month, the unpaid balance compounds daily and a 22% APR translates to 24.5994% APY. <b>PSA: Always pay your credit card balance in full each month to avoid accruing interest.</b></p>
