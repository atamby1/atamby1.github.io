              <h1 class="mb-5">The Wealthy Hand-to-Mouth</h1>
              <p><span class="firstcharacter">K</span>aplan et al define the “wealthy hand-to-mouth” as households with little liquid wealth, but sizable illiquid wealth and argue that this population have a high marginal propensity to consume out of transitory income changes. While Milton Friedman’s permanent income hypothesis says that people spend at a level consistent with their expected long-term average incomes, empirical evidence suggests a large sensitivity of consumption to transitory changes in income. Also, consumption growth does not correlate with the real interest rate. The existence of “hand-to-mouth” consumers who spend all of their available resources every pay period accounts for this inconsistency. Those who challenge this view (that HtM consumers have a high marginal propensity to consume out of transitory income changes) claim that the fraction of households with near-zero net worth is too small to model.</p>
              <p>The current literature that models that measure HtM behavior miss wealthy HtM households because they are classified as HNWI. Kaplan et al claim that poor HtM and wealthy HtM households both have a large marginal propensity to consume out of small transitory income fluctuations; however, wealthy HtM households are more similar to non-HtM households in other dimensions.</p>
              <p>Wealthy households may choose to consume all of their income every period instead of using their wealth to smooth shocks because they may prefer to invest their wealth in illiquid assets rather than liquidating assets and foregoing higher returns.</p>
              <p>In the US, 25-40% (call it 33%) of households are HtM. Of this population, 1/3 are poor HtM and 2/3 are wealth HtM, meaning 2/3 of HtM households are missed by standard measures of poverty based on net worth. Younger households are most frequently poor HtM and wealth HtM households peak at age 40. The median illiquid wealth held by wealthy HtM 40-year olds is $50,000. Wealth HtM households are similar to non-HtM households in income and illiquid wealth, and wealthy HtM status is more transient than poor HtM status.</p>
              <p>In the other countries in the study (Canada, Australia, UK, Germany, France, Italy, Spain), wealthy HtM represent a greater share of HtM than poor HtM. In Canada, the U, and Germany, HtM households represent more than 30% of the population, but in Australia, France, Italy, and Spain, they represent less than 20%. In the EU, debt is minimal, which suggests that their liquid wealth may act as a substitute for credit access. HtM status is predictive of consumption response to transitory shocks. HtM households have a stronger response than non-HtM households, but HtM households split by net worth (regardless of liquidity) respond similarly.</p>
              <p>To illustrate what determines HtM behavior, Kaplan et al introduce a model with 3 periods (0, 1, 2) and households only consume in the last 2 periods. We assume the utility of consuming in period 1 + the utility of consuming in period 2 represents today’s preference, households do not discount over time (they are equally happy consuming in p1 as they are consuming in p2, households are happier when they consume more, but each extra unit of consumption brings a little less extra happiness (diminishing returns).</p>
              <p>Initial endowment omega can be invested into illiquid asset a with a return of R in p0, is inaccessible in p1, and is sold for consumption in p2. It can otherwise be invested into liquid asset m which can be accessed in p1, but pays a return of 1 less than R. At t=1, households receive income y1 and decide whether or not to access their liquid asset. At t2, they receive income y2 and consume y2.</p>
              <p>Non HtM households have positive liquid assets at t2 and will consume equally in t1 and t2. Poor HtM households have no liquid or illiquid assets at t2. Wealth HtM households have positive illiquid assets, but no liquid assets at t2. For HtM households, c1 less than c2.</p>
              <p>High illiquid returns means a higher tolerance for differences in consumption because there will be a higher return in p2, so higher consumption in p2, so higher consumption overall. High income growth reduces the appeal of illiquid assets. High elasticity of intertemporal substitution means high tolerance to shift consumption from p1 to p2, so higher likelihood to invest in the illiquid assets even if income growth is high.</p>
              <p>Wealthy HtM households invest in the illiquid asset at t0, they cannot tap into their wealth at t1, so the marginal value of income at t1 is higher for wealthy HtM than poor HtM and wealthy HtM are constrained at t1; however, lifetime consumption compensates for the welfare loss from the constrained consumption at t1.</p>
              <p>If there is a positive income shock after the t0 investment but before the consumption decision at t1, non HtM households have a marginal propensity to consume of 1/2 at t1 and 1/2 at t2 because they will smooth their consumption across both periods. If the shock is small enough that it does not change HtM status at t1, all HtM households will spend this extra income at t1.</p>
              <p>HtM households at the zero kink have maximum liquid wealth on pay day at time t and average cash on hand (or liquid wealth m) that falls linearly until it hits 0 immediately before the next pay day. Liquid wealth instantly return to its maximum on the following pay day at time t+1. Average liquid balance in a pay period is 1/2 of income.</p>
              <p>So HtM agents on the zero kink are defined as having positive liquid balance less than or equal to earnings in the pay period (half because we assume resources are consumed at a constant rate). Poor HtM have 0 or negative illiquid wealth while wealthy HtM have positive illiquid wealth. Illiquid wealth is negative when borrowers are underwater on their mortgages due to a decline in house prices. These households are counted in the poor HtM category because even though they have illiquid assets, they cannot extract any equity from it and so behave more similarly to households with no illiquid assts. This HtM definition is conservative (a lower bound on the number of HtM households) because while we assume all non-HtMs hold liquid balance above half their earnings, some HtMs may also, but are not counted as HtM.</p>
              <p>HtM agents at the credit limit are defined spending all of their income and available credit in a pay period. It has maximum liquid wealth equal to pay period earnings minus the credit limit (because these households are assumed to have maxed out their credit at all times). Cash on hand falls linearly through the pay period until it reaches a minimum of the negative credit limit. Again, poor HtMs have 0 or negative illiquid assets while wealthy HtMs have positive illiquid assets. All HtMs have average cash on hand within a pay period below 0 (otherwise they would be at the 0 kink), and less than or equal to half of pay period earnings minus credit limit (credit limit equivalent to 1 month of income).</p>
              <p>To account for consumption commitments, Kaplan et al assume that these commitments are incurred smoothly over the period so that liquid assets minus half of committed expenses is less than (income minus commitments) / 2 which simplifies to the baseline measurement (liquid wealth less than equal to half of income).</p>
              <p>A household is HtM in net worth if net worth (liquid + illiquid assets) is less than or equal to half of pay period income (0 kink) or if nw is less than or equal to half of pay period income minus credit limit.</p>
              <p>To estimate cash holdings, Kaplan et al compute the ratio of average cash holdings to the median value of checking, saving, money market, and call accounts and inflate the liquid assets by this ratio.</p>
              <p>Median net worth to median income ranges from about 1:1 in Germany and the US to 6:1 in the UK, Italy and Spain. Europe uses less credit. Figures shows the distribution of net liquid wealth to monthly income. In Germany, only 48% of the population are homeowners, so median housing wealth is 0. Median housing equity relative to median annual income is high in Italy and Spain (6:1). Private retirement wealth varies depending on public pension systems (lower private retirement in EU). Life insurance is higher in the EU.</p>
              <p>Between 1989 and 2010, 31% of US households are HtM, split into 1/2 poor and 2/3 wealthy. Looking at HtM only by net worth shows only 14% of households are HtM, much less than 31% as defined by the liquid wealth definition. Of homeowners with a leverage ratio of 0 (no mortgage debt), 20% of them are HtM, all wealthy. This share rises to the point where of homeowners whose mortgage payment is 90-100% of income, 40% of the homeowners in that leverage ratio bracket are HtM and those with mortgage payments exceeding income, 50%+ of those homeowners are HtM, and most are poor HtM. Leverage ratio is a strong predictor of HtM status.</p>
              <p>If we set pay periods to 1 month rather than 2 weeks, share of HtMs increase. Symmetrically, if pay periods are 1 week, HtM share falls. 1 month pay periods means more income in a pay period, so more liquid wealth is necessary to reach half of income, so more HtMs.</p>
              <p>Financially fragile are less than $2,000 away from the liquid wealth threshold for being defined as HtM, meaning less than half of income + $2,000.</p>
              <p>Baseline wealthy HtM have at last $1 in illiquid wealth. Robustness test at $1,000.</p>
              <p>Results show that wealthy HtMs have the highest marginal propensity to consume, consuming around 30% of unexpected transitory income shocks whose effect entirely dissipates within the period. Poor HtMs consume 24% and non-HtMs consume 13%.</p>
              <p>Separating the wealthy HtM from the poor HtM can allow for more targeted fiscal policy stimuli as wealthy HtMs have the highest MPC. Although they are usually counted as non-HtM due to their large illiquid assets, they behave more like poor HtMs and excluding them from fiscal stimuli may put them under increased financial duress during recessions. Conversely, and perhaps as evidenced by the recent bout of post-pandemic inflation, providing them with fiscal stimuli will have a large impact on overall consumption, which may drive up prices and contribute to inflation.</p>
