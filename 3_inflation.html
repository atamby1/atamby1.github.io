              <h1 class="mb-5">Inflation</h1>
              <p><span class="firstcharacter">I</span>nflation is the process by which currency loses is purchasing power. The United States Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank target an annual inflation rate of 2%. Why? Because it is widely believed to be an ideal rate to keep the economy growing at a sustainable level. There's no strong reason to target 2% specifically except for that in 1990, New Zealand was grappling with inflation and representatives from their finance department and central bank aimed for an inflation target of between 0% and 2%. Then they started popularize it in meetings with other central banks, and it eventually became the norm.</p>

                <figcaption>CPI for All Urban Consumers: All Items in U.S. City Average is 307.48 as of September 2023. The CPI was at 100 in July/August 1983.</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>Notice the sharp increase in the CPI-U since early 2021. This increase in inflation is what has economists worried. The CPI-U index value as of September  2023 is 307.481. Using 1983 as a baseline index value of 100, this means that the CPI-U <b>on average</b> has increased by 2.85% annually for the past 40 years, higher than the Federal Reserve's target inflation rate of 2%.</p>
              <p>This target rate of inflation encourages spending and thus economic growth. If you know the money you hold under your mattress won’t be able to buy as much later if you just leave it under your mattress, you have an incentive to spend it now rather than later, thus putting money into the economy and contributing to economic growth. Or maybe you put it in your savings account and the bank you bank with can loan that money to someone else who wants to buy something now. Or you invest it stocks, thereby also contributing to the economy and allowing the company you bought a share of buy things with that money.</p>
              <p>Of course, it is very difficult to achieve an exact annual inflation rate of 2%. By and large, many electronic consumer goods like TVs and cameras are much less expensive than they used to be because the materials used to manufacture them and the supply chains and factories needed to build them work very efficiently. Plus, for durable goods like TVs, people maybe buy them once a decade and technology can change drastically. In an economist's mind, the heavy CRT TVs from the early 2000s are "the same product" as the ultra-thin LEDs of today when referring to the items used for the Consumer Price Index. Other goods and services, especially the cost of higher education and health care are rising much faster than 2% annually. The 2% target is meant to be an overall expectation of what average people buy, based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which includes food, housing, and transportation.. A subcategory of inflation, known as core inflation, strips away items with volatile prices such as food and energy.</p>
              <p>How does the Federal Reserve (Fed) and the ECB try to control inflation? Why, supply and demand of course! The Fed tries to control the supply of money by buying or selling US Treasury securities — bills, notes, and bonds. When the Fed buys bonds, they buy US government debt with new dollars and therefore increases the amount of dollars circulating in the economy. This is a form of expansionary policy since more money in circulation means banks have more money to give loans, companies have more money to research and develop new products, pay higher wages, and people have more money to buy things to expand the economy. The contrasting policy, or contractionary policy is to sell the bonds it bought. When the Fed sells bonds, they sell US government debt and take an equivalent amount of money out of circulation. They do this when inflation starts to get too high above the 2% target. When there is too much money chasing too few goods and services, prices go up and people can’t afford to buy things anymore. So to combat this increase in prices, reducing the supply of money puts the brakes on manufacturing, fewer goods and services are produced, people demand fewer goods and services, and prices stabilize.</p>
              <p>They also try to control inflation by controlling the demand for money or the price of money through interest rates, specifically the Federal Funds Rate. The FFR is the target rate set by the Federal Open Market Committee and is the rate at which banks borrow and lend their excess cash reserves to each other overnight. Banks have to have a a set amount of money in reserve at the Fed. The amount depends on how “systemically important” the bank is and how much. It is leveraged (how much debt it has). If they dip below their reserve level, they must borrow from another bank at the FFR and a bank with excess reserve can lend it to them. A higher Federal Funds Rate means it is more expensive for banks to borrow from each other, and banks pass on that higher price to consumers, meaning they will charge higher interest rates for loans to companies and consumers — higher car loans, higher mortgage rates, etc.</p>
              <p>The Eurozone equivalent of the Federal Funds Rate, to my understanding, consists of 3 key rates: the interest rate on the main refinancing operations, the interest rate on the marginal lending facility, and the interest rate on the deposit facility. The MLF is the overnight rate banks pay when borrowing from the ECB, probably the closest equivalent to the FFR. The MRO is the 7-day lending rate (less than the MLF), and the DF which is the interest banks receive for depositing money with the ECB overnight.</p>
              <p>While the Fed buys US treasury bonds without limit and in times of crisis, can even buy commercial paper, the ECB lends cash to eligible banks (of which there are about 1,500) in exchange for collateral (public debt of member states, but private banking securities are also accepted). The ECB is sort of set up like a corporation in the sense that it has shareholders and stock capital. Largest shareholders are Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Netherlands, Belgium, Austria, Greece, Portugal, Ireland, Slovakia.</p>
              <p>The euro is particularly complicated because the ECB controls monetary policy for the entire euro area while individual countries each have their own fiscal policy agendas. One country maybe be experiencing high inflation, while another may be experience low growth, so they ECB must balance the monetary needs of both. Members of the Eurozone, in theory, are supposed to have annual deficits not exceeding 3% of GDP and total debt not exceeding 60% of GDP. Most countries do not follow this rule.</p>
