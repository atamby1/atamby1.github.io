              <h1 class="mb-5">Money creation in the modern economy</h1>
              <p><span class="firstcharacter">T</span>his is a summary and my key takeaways from the articles titled <b>Money creation in the modern economy: an introduction</b> and its companion piece <b>Money creation in the modern economy</b> both by Michael McLeay, Amar Radia and Ryland Thomas of the Bank of England’s Monetary Analysis Directorate, published in the <i>Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin</i> in 2014 Q1.</p>
              <h4>Money creation in the modern economy: an introduction</h4>
              <p>Money has 3 principal roles: First, it must be a store of value, meaning its value must be reasonably predictable over time. Second, it must be a unit of account so that it can be used to price goods and services. Third, it must be a medium of exchange, meaning that that it is something people hold and exchange for goods and services.</p>
              <p>In a subsistence economy, or autarky, the economy only consumes what it produces — there is no trade. But specialization allows increased efficiency and when people specialize or focus on producing a specific good or service, they can trade what they produce with others. But since not all goods and services are good stores of value or mediums of exchange, money serves as an intermediary to make trade easier. Historically, some commodities have been used as money (e.g. gold or copper coins), but many of these commodities have other uses for example to make jewelry or to use as materials in electronics, so there is a cost to use them as money. So in the modern economy, money is used as a financial asset instead of commodities.</p>
              <p>Financial assets are claims on someone else in the economy so your asset is their liability. When you buy a bond, you have an asset (the bond debt) and the government has a liability because it must pay you back. When you take out a mortgage with you bank, the bank has an asset (your mortgage debt) and you have a liability because you must pay it back. The sum of all financial assets is equal to the sum of all financial liabilities. Since modern economies are very large and there are so many transactions happening every minute of every day, money is introduce as a social institution that removes the need for people to rely too much on trusting everyone they do business.</p>
              <p>Currency is made up of banknotes and coins and represents a financial liability for the central bank and an asset for whoever holds the currency. If you look at a dollar bill, you will see that it is a “Federal Reserve Note”. Most currencies are no longer convertible into commodities today as they once were during the era of the “gold standard” (see my post on Bretton Woods and the Gold Standard). You can still buy commodities like gold, but the price of gold fluctuates. Currencies today are rather fiat money, meaning they are not backed by commodities. British economic historians argue that abandoning the gold standard in 1931 allowed the UK to have more control over the amount of money in its economy and avoid as deep of an economic depression as the rest of the world. Using fiat money for an entire economy requires all individuals in the economy to trust that the currency will be used by everyone else as an accepted medium of exchange. This is similar to driving conventions. In the US and in France, everyone trusts that motorists will drive on the right side of the road, and since everyone is expected to do so, everyone follows this convention and people can drive more safely. In order to ensure that everyone (or at least as many people as possible) in the economy trust the currency, the government accepts the currency as tax payments and makes banknotes difficult to counterfeit and try to control inflation to ensure the currency retains its store of value and its use as a medium of exchange. When abandoning the gold standard, governments switched from ensuring that currencies could be exchanged for a specific amount of gold to ensuring that currencies could be exchanged a stable amount of real goods and services from one year to the next.</p>
              <p>Most people don’t hold their money in the form of banknotes under their mattresses at home because it’s not very secure. You could lose that money or someone could steal it. Plus because of inflation, its value slowly erodes over time. People generally prefer to keep their money in banks in the form of bank deposits where it can accrue interest and where it is kept safe (this is not the case in countries where people don’t trust the financial system like in Argentina for example). But people need to trust that they can access the money in their bank accounts whenever they want. For this reason, banks keep minimum reserve levels for people who want to withdraw cash. The government also guarantees that you you can access the money in your bank account no matter what, even if the bank fails (in the US all checking accounts are with banks or credit unions are guaranteed by the FDIC or NCUA up to $250,000). Bank deposits by far are the most dominant form of money (upwards of 95%).</p>
              <h4>Money creation in the modern economy</h4>
              <p>There are 2 common misconceptions about money creation:
                <dl>
                  <dt>First</dt>
                  <dd><b>Misconception</b>: Banks only lend out deposits that savers place with them.</dd>
                  <dd><b>Truth</b>: Banks create deposit money and saving does not by itself increase the funds available to lend.</dd>
                  <dt>Second</dt>
                  <dd><b>Misconception</b>: The ‘money multiplier’ approach that says that central banks determine the amount of loans and deposits in the economy by controlling the amount of central bank money.</dd>
                  <dd><b>Truth</b>: Central banks implement monetary policy by setting the interest rates on reserves</dd>
                </dl>
              </p>
              <p>Broad money is the total amount of bank deposits (between commercial banks and individuals) and currency (between commercial banks and the central bank). Most broad money is in the form of bank deposits rather than currency. When you take out a $100,000 loan to buy a house, for example, the bank does not give you $100,000 in actual bills of cash money. They deposit $100,000 into the seller’s bank account, and when that deposit is made, money is created. As you pay your mortgage to pay off your debt, that money is destroyed with each monthly payment. The bank doesn’t actually have the $100,000 from this mortgage in its coffers, but the seller is allowed to withdraw that money whenever they want. For this reason, banks must keep a minimum reserve level of currency with the central bank. It doesn’t need to keep the total value of its deposits because not all depositors will try to withdraw their money at the same time and start a bank run (lest we have another Great Depression), but they need to keep enough to satisfy a governmentally mandated minimum level.</p>
              <p>Banks will often hold government bonds as part of their portfolio because they are liquid and can quickly be sold to the central bank in exchange for currency. Banks cannot just freely create money and give out as many loans as it wants without any constraints or limitations. The amount of money they can create and lend is limited by:
                <ul>
                  <li>Limits on how much banks can lend since they can only lend if it’s profitable and if they stay within the confines of the risk mitigation strategies and regulations.</li>
                  <li>The behavior of the money holders since they can immediately pay back loans, destroying the money created by deposits.</li>
                  <li>Monetary policy imposed by the central bank through interest rates.</li>
                </ul> 
                </p>
              <p>In order to lend profitably, banks charge higher interest rates on their assets than they pay on their liabilities. So the interest the bank receives when individuals pay their mortgages is higher than the interest banks pay you on your savings account balance. This difference pays for the bank’s operating costs and contributes to the bank’s profits.</p>
              <p>If you take out a mortgage with your bank to buy a house, your bank creates money and deposits it into your account. You then immediately transfer that money to the seller’s account, but the seller probably uses a different bank than you. You now have an asset (a house) and a liability (a loan). Your bank has an asset (your loan), but has now transferred reserves covering the loan amount to the seller’s bank, which puts it in a risky position—it might not have enough money to cover its outflows if people want to withdraw money from their accounts. So your bank may increase the interest rates on their savings accounts to encourage depositors to save with them and increase its reserves. These market forces encouraging banks to lower their lending rates and increase their savings account rates while remaining profitable limit how much banks can lend.</p>
              <p>Banks are also limited in their ability to create loans because they need to minimize liquidity risk, that is, they need to minimize the likelihood that they won’t have enough reserves to pay for potential surges in withdrawals and they must minimize credit risk, or the likelihood that borrowers default on their loans. They protect themselves against liquidity risk by offering high interest savings accounts or certificates of deposit to encourage customers to keep their money in the bank. They protect themselves against credit risk by charging higher interest rates on riskier loans (loans with high LTVs for example). In the years leading up to the financial crisis, banks were lending a lot and largely ignored or didn’t see the growing credit risk. House prices were appreciating, so banks assumed that even if riskier borrowers defaulted, they would be able to foreclose the house and sell it at a profit. That was a poor assumption to make.</p>
              <p>When money is created, it can be destroyed if debt is paid off quickly (referred to as reflux theory), or it can be used for spending which leads to inflation.</p>
              <p>The ultimate constraint on money creation is the monetary policy set by the central bank. In the UK, the Monetary Policy Committee (the British equivalent to the Federal Open Market Committee with in the Federal Reserve System in the US) sets the short term interest rate paid on central bank reserves held by commercial banks. I will write a more detailed post on how central banks use open market operations to set policy rates as explained in the article “The Bank’s money market framework” by Roger Clews, Chris Salmon and Olaf Weeken of the Bank of England’s Sterling Markets Division, published in the Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin in 2010 Q4.</p>
              <p>The central bank can increase its policy rate to limit money creation, but there is a lower bound of 0% interest rates to encourage money creation. When the central bank wants to encourage lending when the policy rate is at its lower bound, it can use quantitative easing. When using QE, the central bank buys sovereign bonds and finances these purchases by creating money and depositing that money into the central bank reserves of the commercial banks selling those bonds. The commercial banks can now have extra deposits they can use to buy other assets and encourage economic activity. It is important to note that the commercial bank cannot lend out its central bank reserve balance, but since their reserve balance has increased, they have more flexibility to make purchases with the deposits they have in-house.</p>
              <p>When using QE, the central bank buys bonds from non-bank financial companies like pension funds, but since non-bank financial institutions don’t have reserve accounts with the central bank, its bank deposits the CB’s purchase amount into the pension fund’s bank account in exchange for bonds and the CB deposits the purchase amount into the bank’s reserve account in exchanges for the bonds. While the new money “belongs” to the pension fund, it is stored in the bank and the bank can use it to create money in the form of loans (so long as the pension fund doesn’t withdraw all of it). But it doesn’t have to. The pension fund could use that money to pay debt, therefore destroying money. QE is not meant to create money, it is meant to increase private sector spending directly and circumventing the banking sector.</p>
